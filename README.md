Hi👋, my name is Zhenhua Du (杜振华). I'm currently a Master student at [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/) (NUDT), working with Prof. Kai Huo and Prof. [Shuaifeng Zhi](https://shuaifengzhi.com/). My research interests lie in computer vision and robotics, with a current focus on scene reconstruction and semantic understanding. 

Nice to meet you! I'm excited for any chatting or disscussion about future spatial AI :D

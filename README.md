# Hi there👋I'm Zhenhua Du😄
I'm currently a M.Eng. student at National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), supervised by Kai Huo and [Shuaifeng Zhi](https://shuaifengzhi.com/). Before that, I also received my Bachelor's degree from NUDT in 2022.

My research interest lies in computer vision and robotics, especially on Scene Representations and Reconstruction, Semantic Scene Understanding, SLAM, etc. ==My ultimate research goal is to enable robots to autonomously explore, reconstruct, and understand the real world, just like Wall-E==. To achieve this, now I am focusing on the following aspects:
1) ☝Compact representation and efficient reconstruction of the visual world;
2) 👉Open-vocabulary, hierarchical, and interactive understanding of the complex scenes;
3) 👌Applications on intelligent agents constrained by GPU power and real-time requirements, e.g., SLAM, navigation, manipulation.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in discussing these topics with me.🫡

Outside of my research, I enjoy photography, basketball, music and movies.

# Hi thereðŸ‘‹I'm Zhenhua Du
I'm currently a M.Eng. student at [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/) (NUDT), supervised by Kai Huo and [Shuaifeng Zhi](https://shuaifengzhi.com/). Before that, I also received my Bachelor's degree from NUDT in 2022.

## ðŸ¤—Research
My research interests lie in computer vision and robotics, with a current focus on scene reconstruction and semantic understanding. **My ultimate goal is to develop spatial AI capable of autonomously exploring, understanding and interacting
with the real world**. To achieve this, my interest expands into the following areas:
- Efficient representation, reconstruction and simulation of the visual world; 
- Open-vocabulary, hierarchical and interactive understanding of complex scenes;
- Intelligent robotics applications (e.g., SLAM, navigation, manipulation) that are constrained by GPU power and real-time requirements.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in discussing these topics with me.

## ðŸ˜ŽOutside of Research
- I love photography, basketball, music and movies;
- I like chatting with interesting people;
- I enjoy reading and thinking.
